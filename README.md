**Airline Fare Adjustment & Profit–Loss Analysis**

**Background**

Fare adjustments made after ticket issuance can significantly impact airline profitability, particularly through refunds and baggage overbuffer cases. This mini project analyzes fare increases, losses, and refund patterns to identify key risk areas affecting airline revenue.

**Objectives**

- Identify airlines with the highest fare increase and loss
- Analyze routes and flight types with the greatest risk exposure
- Evaluate the impact of refunds and overbuffer baggage on profitability
- Provide business insights to support loss mitigation strategies

**Dataset Overview**

The dataset is a simulated airline transaction dataset, including:

- Airline and route information
- Initial vs final fare
- Fare difference
- Refund and loss values
- Flight type (domestic / international)

Raw data is stored at transaction (row) level without aggregation or pivot tables.

**Key Insights**

- A small number of airlines contribute disproportionately to total losses
- Certain domestic routes experience fare adjustments more frequently
- Overbuffer-related refunds are a major driver of revenue loss
- Fare increases do not always lead to higher profit due to refund exposure

**Tools Used**

- Google Sheets / Excel
- Descriptive data analysis & aggregation
- GitHub for documentation and version control

**Conclusion**

More controlled fare adjustment policies are required, particularly for high-risk routes and airlines with elevated refund rates. Monitoring fare differences and overbuffer patterns can help reduce avoidable losses and improve revenue stability.
